# PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	Many libraries still manage seat reservations manually, leading to inefficiencies and inconvenience for both staff and patrons.The absence of a streamlined digital system result in several issues:
1.	Inefficient Seat Utilization: Without a proper tracking system, seats may remain underutilized or overbooked.
2.	Time-Consuming Processes: Both users and staff spend unnecessary time managing and coordinating seat reservations.
3.	Inaccurate Availability Information: Users may not have real-time information on seat availability, causing frustration and wasted trips.
4.	Limited Accessibility: Manual systems often lack the flexibility needed for users to make or modify reservations remotely.
   
# PROJECT OVERVEIW
The Library Seat Reservation System is a web application developed to streamline the process of reserving library seats. Built using Java, MySQL, basic HTML, and Maven within IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, it serves both users and administrators : 

### User Features: -->
•	Seat Availability Check: Users can view and select available seats.
•	Reservation: Reserve seats for specific hours.
•	Check-In/Check-Out: Manage reservations effectively.

### Admin Features: -->
•	Reservation Management: View and manage all reservations.
•	Seat Maintenance: Cancel reservations for damaged seats.
•	User Management: Add new users to the system.

# TECHINICAL STACKS USED FOR PROJECT 

### •	Frontend Technologies : -->
1.	HTML: For basic web design and structure.
2.	CSS: For styling the HTML pages.
3.	JavaScript: For interactive elements and validation.

### •	Backend Technologies : -->
1.	Java: The primary programming language for building the backend logic.
2.	Servlets & JSP: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
3.	JDBC: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.

### •	Database Management System : --> 
1.	MySQL: The database management system for storing user information, seat details, and reservations.

### •	Development Enviroment : -->
1.	IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding, testing, and debugging the application.
2.	Eclipse 2024 : Eclipse is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for Java development and other programming languages
3.	Maven: For project management and dependency handling.

### •	Version Control : -->
1.	Git & Github : a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers additional features to facilitate collaboration and code management

# FUTURE ENCHANCEMENT -->
The Library Seat Reservation System holds significant promise for future enhancements to boost user experience and operational efficiency. Key areas of expansion include:
a.	Mobile Application Development:Creating mobile apps for Android and iOS to allow users to check seat availability, make reservations, and manage check-ins/check-outs on the go.
b.	Real-Time Seat Monitoring:Implementing IoT sensors to monitor seat occupancy in real-time, providing accurate, up-to-the-minute information on seat availability.
c.	QR Code Check-In/Check-Out: Integrating QR code technology for efficient and contactless check-in and check-out processes, making the system more user-friendly and faster.
d.	Integration with Campus Systems: Linking the reservation system with other campus systems like student portals, ID card systems, and event management platforms to provide a seamless and unified experience for users.
